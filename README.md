### 👩‍💻 About Me  

I am a passionate engineer who loves building **intelligent, scalable, and user-centric systems**, whether that’s crafting a full stack app, optimizing database design, or deploying machine learning models in production.  

Currently pursuing my Master’s in Computer Science at Northeastern University, my work spans **software engineering**, **AI**.  
I have previously contributed to research in **medical AI** and **mental health analytics**, published in IEEE and Springer, and worked on projects that bridge **data-driven intelligence** with **robust backend engineering**.  

⚡ **Fun fact:** I love turning research ideas into real-world systems, from chatbots powered by GPT models to multi-calendar scheduling tools built from scratch.
